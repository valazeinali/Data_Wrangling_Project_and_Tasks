# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks
This is a repo for my course work for QBS181 at Dartmouth College. I have been granted permission to make my work public.

## Project 1

Had to rename all the columns for eg.,calculate the time (in days) to complete enrollment and create a new column to have this data. Create a new column “Enrollment Status" based off certain codes. Create a new Column “Gender” based off certain codes. Create a new column “Age group” and create age groups with an interval of 25 yrs. for example 0-25 years as ‘0-25’, 26-50 as “26-50” and so on...

## Project 2

Create a new column “Enrollment group” in the table Phonecall_encounter based off certain codes. Obtain the # of records for each enrollment group. Merge the Phone call encounter table with Call duration table. Findout the # of records for different call outcomes and call type. Use 1-Inbound and 2-Outbound,for call types; use 1-No response,2-Left voice mail and 3 successful. Pleasealso find the call duration for each of the enrollment groups. Merge the tables Demographics, Conditions and TextMessages. Find the # of texts/per week, by the type of sender. Obtain the countof texts based on the chronic condition over a period of time (say per week).
