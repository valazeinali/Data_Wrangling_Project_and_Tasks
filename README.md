# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks
This is a repo for my course work for QBS181 at Dartmouth College. I have been granted permission to make my work public.

## Project 1

Had to rename all the columns for eg.,calculate the time (in days) to complete enrollment and create a new column to have this data. Create a new column “Enrollment Status" based off certain codes. Create a new Column “Gender” based off certain codes. Create a new column “Age group” and create age groups with an interval of 25 yrs. for example 0-25 years as ‘0-25’, 26-50 as “26-50” and so on...

## Project 2

Create a new column “Enrollment group” in the table Phonecall_encounter based off certain codes. Obtain the # of records for each enrollment group. Merge the Phone call encounter table with Call duration table. Findout the # of records for different call outcomes and call type. Use 1-Inbound and 2-Outbound,for call types; use 1-No response,2-Left voice mail and 3 successful. Pleasealso find the call duration for each of the enrollment groups. Merge the tables Demographics, Conditions and TextMessages. Find the # of texts/per week, by the type of sender. Obtain the countof texts based on the chronic condition over a period of time (say per week). 

## Midterm

Supplied messy data set.  List the data-related issues you see in this data set. How will you address each data-related issue? Give justification for why you chose a particular way to address each issue. For example, if you decide to address missing values by removing rows or filling empty data cells, justify your decision or if you want to create a PHI field like year of Birth. Clean the data by addressing each point listed in 1. Verify that whether the counts of each code or value for various variables are correct as mentioned in the website.

## Project 3
